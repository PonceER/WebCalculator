Activity #3: Simple Web Calculator Test Cases

Consider a simple web calculator server.
1. The simple calculator shall consist of the following simple functions
  a. Add
  b. Subtract
  c. Multiply
  d. Divide
2. All functions are only allowed to take in two integers.
3. All functions are to return with integers except divide which will return a float64 value.
4. Activate the calculator by using URL POST “localhost:8080/calc?action=add&value1=value&value2=value”
5. Return a simple printout on the client browser.
6. Construct simple test cases using boundary and equivalence testing. This will be in preparation for Test Driven Development.
